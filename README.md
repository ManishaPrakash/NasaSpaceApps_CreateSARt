NASA space apps challenge 2023 - Create Art with Synthetic Aperture Radar Data

Our team created a map of the Data collected by the Sentinel-1 mission in Google Earth Engine: https://meryemberrada.projects.earthengine.app/view/sart 

Art was made using the basics of geospatial scattering to produce images in high contrast showing a unique view of Earth. Selected images are made into postcards and are available to download. 

The script used in Google Earth Engine is adapted from online resources and is available in the repository. 
The script for the rotating 3D model of Earth in Three.js is adapted from online resources and is available in the repository. 

A video of the final product of the Space Apps Challenge 2023 is available in YouTube.
